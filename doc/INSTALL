mext maxima distribution (or package) installer.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

See INSTALL-windows.txt for instructions on
installing with wxmaxima on MS Windows.

These are instructions for installing the mext system,
as well as software packaged for mext. Please
also read INSTALL-windows.txt.

There are several ways to install this software.
The following way uses wxmaxima and has been
tested with some combinations of maxima v5.25,
v5.28, gcl/win32, ccl/win32, as well as
six lisps under linux. The details here
assume we are on win32. I have not had time to
port this to mac OS X.

Currently only installation to the user maxima
folder is supported. A separate subfolder is
created for each combination of maxima version and
lisp implementation/version. So you can use
different versions of maxima and implementations
and versions of lisp in parallel.

We use the word 'distribution' to mean a piece of
third party software. This might also be called a
package.  The code in the distribution might
consist of one file, or of several files. Several,
but not all of the packages from the maxima third
party code site are packaged here.
first. (See the note below.)  To install one
distribution, click File-->Load Package and choose
the folder named for the distribution you want to
load. Click on the file 'ibuild.mac' in this
folder to build and install the distribution.
