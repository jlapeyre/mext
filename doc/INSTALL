mext maxima distribution (or package) installer.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

See INSTALL-windows.txt for instructions on
installing with wxmaxima on MS Windows.

These are instructions for installing the mext system,
as well as software packaged for mext. Please
also read INSTALL-windows.txt.

In linux, you can install to your .maxima directory by running
./install_mext.sh

Currently only installation to the user maxima
folder is supported. A separate subfolder is
created for each combination of maxima version and
lisp implementation/version. So you can use
different versions of maxima and implementations
and versions of lisp in parallel.
