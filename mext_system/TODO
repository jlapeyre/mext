Functions and symbols can be clobbered with kill(all);
require() and mext_provide() don't know about this. 

Quick solution would be to have mext_provide define a symbol that will
be clobbered by kill(all). require() can check this symbol. Another
solution would be to use a different function in place of kill, say
mkill, that checks an additional property and only kills symbols
that do not have it.
