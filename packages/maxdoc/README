maxdoc

maxdoc extends the maxima online documentation system.

The command-line interface to the maxima manual is modified to allow
other documents to be displayed with ? and ??  and to allow other
systems to make queries. The documentation system is divided into
three parts: a) databases.  b) querying and organizing component. c)
front ends.  Databases are registered with the querying component by
sending a struct. The original describe command line interface calls
the querying component. There are four examples of databases:

 a) the maxima info database.

 b) simple-doc. This is available immediately. (I later saw this is
    similar to L. Butler's code.)

   (%i3) simple_doc_add("new_function", "The new description.");

   (%o3) "new_function"
   (%i4) ? new_function

      The new description.

   (%o4) true

 c) max-doc, a more capable documentation database, but not
  coherent.  It would be nice if there were a lisp parser of
  gnu texinfo code. The idea is to make it easy to convert
  to normal maxima doc.

 d) developer or internal documentation. Eg, there is a macro
    ddefun that expands to defun but also captures the doc
    string to a database along with the name of the source
    file, and lambda list. This is then also available via ? and ??.

 There is a variable controlling sending the output to a pager, as
 well, that only works with some lisp/platfrom combinations.

 See the README in defmfun1 for more information on maxdoc.

------
The maxdoc distribution requires that mext and defmfun1
be built and installed.

Build like this:

load("./build.mac");
mext_dist_user_install();
