Many of the functions here are already defined in
mext-maxima-system.lisp, which provides the bare minimum
of the mext system.

They are redefined here to take advantage of defmfun1 and maxdoc, 
which depends on, and can only be build after, the mext_system.

The defmfun1 definitions allow sophisitcated argument checking,
threading, documentation, etc.
