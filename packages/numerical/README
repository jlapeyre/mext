This package is called numerical in
the sense of numerical integration, etc.

nintegrate --

High-level numerical integration.

This is only a simple front-end. It is not very powerful and not very
featureful.  It does put a few of the quadpack routines under a common
interface.

nintegrate does not handle:

multi-dimensional integrals
complex numbers
arbitrary precision computation.
