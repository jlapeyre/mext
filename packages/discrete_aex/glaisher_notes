Get glaisher.txt and convert to maxima
bigfloat.

1) Download glaisher.txt
2) Cut and paste number into emacs file
   as glaisher.mac
3) set-fill-column 30000
4) ESC-Q to re-wrap the number. It is
   converted to 1 line because the number
   digits is 2025 + a few other characters.
5) replace-regexp , space nothing(carriage return)
   This removes several spaces.
6) Type 'b0;' at the end and 
   '%Glaisher_bigfloat :' at the front.
7) load("glaisher.mac");
8) confirm precision(%Glaisher_bigfloat) --> 20025

Note that this relies on my modification of the
reading of bigfloats to set ffprec while
reading in order to keep all digits.
