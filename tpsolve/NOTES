In order to protect nary property from kill(all)
(or kill(props)), we put something like this in dontkill.mac.

dont_kill("%and","%or");

To see properties of these ops, we must to
properties("%and"), rather than properties(%and).

There are a number of dependencies:

Some things are still loaded multiple times, as in the
stock version, but they are usually fairly fast.
