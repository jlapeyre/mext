aex

aex allows representing maxima expressions with lisp arrays.

With this package, maxima lists and list-like expressions can be
represented by lisp arrays. This can be more efficient, for instance
random access to elements is neccessary. For example

 (%i1) lrange(5);
 (%o1) [1,2,3,4,5]
 (%i2) lrange(5, ot->ar);
 (%o2) <[1,2,3,4,5]>

See the example ae_rand_perm.mac in this directory.
