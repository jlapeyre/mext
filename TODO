in src/float.lisp,
fpround cannot accept a lisp ratio. This could be fixed

defmfun1 auto documentation does not give the default value of
optional variables. It should!

Spurious warning because of unevaluated arguments in table.

(%i7) table(integer_length(100!, n), [n, 2, 20]);
Warning: integer_length: Argument 'n' at position 2 is not an integer greater than one in integer_length(933262154439441526816992388562667004907159682 ... .

(%o7) [525,332,263,227,204,187,175,166,158,152,147,142,138,135,132,129,126,124,122]

Can be avoided like this. but that does not solve the bug.

(%i9) integer_length(100!, lrange(2,20));
(%o9) [525,332,263,227,204,187,175,166,158,152,147,142,138,135,132,129,126,124,122]

loading mext_core is pretty fast, but could be super-fast.
I think the problem is that documents are extracted and
built at load time, not compile time. This has advantages,
but there should be an option to store the documents,
and data structures at compile time.
