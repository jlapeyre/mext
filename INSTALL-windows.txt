mext maxima distribution (or package) installer.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
for wxmaxima on MS Windows.

---------------------------------------------------

1) Download the source from github (google for
 maxima mext github), using the "download this
 repository as a zip file" button.

2) Right-click on the downloaded zip file and choose
Extract all files. When prompted for a destination,
click 'Browse...'. You can extract it anywhere, but
here, we assume you browse to your home folder,
 C:\Users\username.
Click 'OK'. Click 'Extract. The files should be extracted
to a folder called C:\Users\username\mext-master, or
something like that.
  
 Warning: if the timestamps of the extracted files are in the future
  with respect to your system, defsystem will compile in semi-infinite
  loops, repeatedly ask questions, and ignore the answers. I have not
  yet found found a way to defeat this.

3) Install the mext_system distribution (package)
to your user maxima folder, as follows:  All other
distributions packaged for mext depend on
mext_system (mext). 

 * Open wxmaxima. 
 * Click the menu File-->Load Package. 
 * Browse to where you extracted the zip file and 
   browse to the folder mext-master --> mext_system. 
 * At the bottom right of the file dialog change the filter
   from 'Maxima package (*.mac)' to
   'Lisp package (*.lisp)'.
 * Click on the LISP file `00mext-ibuild'. 
 * Click 'open'.  

If all goes well, mext should be installed.

4) Install distributions packaged for mext. Just
to be safe, restart maxima or wxmaxima. (menu item
Maxima->Restart Maxima). Here we show how to
install several distributions at once. Below we
show how to install them one at a time.

  NOTE: 
   If you build or install the mext packages
  'quicklisp' or 'store', you must have an
  internet connection so that quicklisp can
  download asdf lisp packages. These two packages
  do *not* work with gcl, which is the lisp
  used to build the standard version of Maxima
  5.30.0 for windows.

 * Edit the file mext-master\buildall.mac to include all or some of
 the distributions. (there are some dependencies; see below.)

  Note: Both of the packages 'discrete' and 'lists_aex' have a
  function called `count'. If both are installed, errors can
  occur. For instance, mext_test('all) will load them both and then
  run tests, some of which will cause maxima to crash.
  Renaming the function in one of the packages solves the problem.

 * Click File-->Load Package and choose the file
 mext-master\buildall.mac.  This should build and install all
 packages. Maxima might seem to be hung sometimes, so you have to be
 patient.

 NOTE: If an error occurs, try fixing the problem, then restart maxima
 and reload buildall.mac. For instance, if 'bernstein' is not
 available, remove the string "bernstein" from buildall.mac, then
 restart maxima before continuing.

* Restart maxima, especially if you have built the package
 `discrete'. There is a bug that prevents it from being
  loaded twice.

* Assuming you did not build both `discrete' and `lists_aex':
 After restarting maxima. Type

 load(mext_core);
 mext_test('all);

 If you did build both packages (without renaming 'count'), then
 you can do mext_test() on individual packages. Try
 ?? mext_test.

* Some other commands to try are: (Use ?? to see documentation)
  mext_list, mext_list_loaded.

* require(packname) loads an installed package. These are listed
  via mext_list().

* mext_list_package(packname) lists functions and variables
  defined in `packname'. This only works if `packname' has
  been loaded.

* To see some documentation, try
  ?? runtime
  ?? lists
  ?? numeric
  ?? combinat

---------------------------------------------------

* The prime counting function is packaged
separately because the tables are relatively
large. Google github prime_pi, to find this
package.

You can also try reading and loading testall.mac.

To see some documentation, restart maxima and type
 load(mext);
 require('all);
 print_maxdoc_sections();

---------------------------------------------------
* Installing one-by-one. Some distributions depend
on others, so you have to install the dependencies
first. (See the note below.)  To install one
distribution, click File-->Load Package and choose
the folder named for the distribution you want to
load. Click on the file 'ibuild.mac' in this
folder to build and install the distribution.

Dependencies:  A depends on B is written A -> B
All distributions depend on mext_system.
Any distribution not listed here depends only on mext_system.

  maxdoc -> defmfun1
  aex -> maxdoc
  lists_aex -> aex
  discrete_aex -> lists_aex
  alt_eigen -> maxdoc
  nelder_mead -> maxdoc
  quicklisp -> maxdoc
  store -> quicklisp
