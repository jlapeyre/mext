Note that some code here relies on defmfun1/doc-system.lisp.
Some of the doc system had to be moved there, so that defmfun1
will be aware of it.

This is my best understanding, reading my code after a year or so.
But there may be some errors:

The mext or maxdoc or whatever doc system interacts with/ borrows
from the Maxima documentation system in three files:

defmfun1/doc-system.lisp
maxdoc/descr1.lisp
maxdoc/info-database.lisp

The only code that replaces (overwrites) the stock Maxima code is
$describe, which is defined in descr1.lisp.
But, $describe calls code that effectively replacest the
stock maxima code.
