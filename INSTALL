mext maxima distribution (or package) installer.

There are several ways to install this software.
The following way uses wxmaxima and has been
tested under gcl/win32, ccl/win32, as well as
several lisps under linux.  The details here
assume we are on win32.

Currently only installation to the user maxima
folder is supported. A separate subfolder is
created for each combination of maxima version and
lisp implementation/version. So you can use
different versions of maxima and implementations
and versions of lisp in parallel.

We use the word 'distribution' to mean a piece of
third party software. This might also be called a
package.  The code in the distribution might
consist of one file, or of several files. Several,
but not all of the packages from the maxima third
party code site are pacakged here.

* Download the source from github (google for
 maxima mext github), using the "download this
 repository as a zip file" button.

* Right-click on the downloaded zip file and choose
Extract all files. When prompted for a destination,
click 'Browse...'. You can extract it anywhere, but
here, we assume you browse to your home folder,
 C:\Users\username.
Click 'OK'. Click 'Extract. The files should be extracted
to a folder called C:\Users\username\mext-master, or
something like that.
  
  Warning: if the timestamps of the extracted files are in the future
   with respect to your system, defsystem will compile in semi-infinite
   loops, repeatedly ask questions, and ignore the answers. I have not
   yet found found a way to defeat this.

* Intstall the mext_system distribution (package)
to your user maxima folder, as follows.  All other
distributions packaged for mext depend on
mext_system (mext). Open wxmaxima. Click menu
File-->Load Package. Browse to where you extracted
the zip file and choose mext-master --> mext_system. At the
bottom of the file dialog change the filter to
read 'lisp'. Click on the LISP file
'mext-ibuild'. Click 'open'.  If all goes well,
mext should be installed.

* Install other software. Just to be safe, restart maxima or
wxmaxima. (menu item Maxima->Restart Maxima). Here we show
how to install several distributions at once. Below we show
how to install them one at a time.

  NOTE: If you build or install 'quicklisp' or
  'store', you must have an internet connection so
  that quicklisp can download asdf lisp packages.

Edit the file mext-master\buildall.mac to include
all or some of the distributions. All are included
by default. (there are some dependencies; see
below.)  Then click File-->Load Package and choose
the file mext-master\buildall.mac.  This should
build and install all packages. Maxima might seem
to be hung sometimes, so you have to be patient.

* The prime counting function is packaged
separately becaues the tables are relatively
large. Google github prime_pi, to find this
package.

You can also try reading and loading testall.mac.

To see some documentation, restart maxima and type
 load(mext);
 require('all);
 print_max_doc_sections();

* Installing one-by-one. Some distributions depend
on others, so you have to install the dependencies
first. (See the note below.)  To install one
distribution, click File-->Load Package and choose
the folder named for the distribution you want to
load. Click on the file 'ibuild.mac' in this
folder to build and install the distribution.
